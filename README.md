# Color-Flipper

Repository name: Color-Flipper

Description:
This GitHub repository contains two JavaScript programs that dynamically change the background color of a webpage. One program uses predefined color names, while the other generates random hexadecimal color codes. These projects are great for learning how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) and handle user interactions with JavaScript.

Key Features:
1) Color Switcher with Named Colors: The first script allows you to change the background color by clicking a button. It randomly selects a color from a predefined list of named colors and updates the background accordingly.

2) Hexadecimal Color Generator: The second script generates random hexadecimal color codes, creating a unique and visually appealing background with each click. It demonstrates how to construct hex color codes and apply them to the webpage.

Getting Started:
To use these color changers in your project, follow these steps:
1) Clone this repository to your local machine.
2) Open the HTML file in your preferred web browser to see the color changers in action.
3) Explore the JavaScript code in the respective files to understand how each color-changing mechanism works.
4) Feel free to integrate these scripts into your own web projects for dynamic background color changes.
